> Simple Visual Text Editor


The goal of this project is to create a simple graphical and moderately feature rich text editor with SDL2 and C++. 

We'll start with simple things, however tricky it may be does not matter.

1. Read, Write, Save.
2. Displaying contents of text files 
3. Window splitting.
4. Terminal commands.
