## SVTE
> SDL2 Virtual Text Editor

A text editor.
Very much in early stages of development.

## What needs to get done:
1. Implement writing of buffers.
2. Switching of buffers (partially implemented, but not done).
3. Move to end of current word and move to start of current word.
4. Multiple buffers in view (split windows). SDL Viewport is great for this.
5. Rendering logic/culling/camera control.
6. Cut/Paste/Selections.
7. Looks/Aesthetics/Customizability.

## What's been done:
1. Reading of text files.
2. Editing text buffers (Insert, Remove, Delete).
3. Move to start of previous word and move to start of next word.
4. Move to prev/next lines.
5. Single buffer rendering.
6. Char atlases.
